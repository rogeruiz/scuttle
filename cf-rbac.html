  Note over Orgs: An org is a development account that an individual or multiple collaborators can own and use. All collaborators access an org with user accounts. Collaborators in an org share a resource quota plan, applications, services availability, and custom domains.

  Note over Spaces: Every application and service is scoped to a space. Each org contains at least one space. A space provides users with access to a shared location for application development, deployment, and maintenance. Each space role applies only to a particular space.
